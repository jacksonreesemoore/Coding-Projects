# Coding-Projects
This repository contains various coding projects I have made through my college career.

The Image Resizer and Negative is coded in C and takes in a PPM image, creates a negative of that image, and allows the user to also resize the image to their desired size in pixels. 
To increase the size of the image, you input a positive number of pixels to increase the size by. To decrease the size, enter a negative number. 

The extended Tic Tac Toe game is coded in Java. The source code and test cases can be found inside cpsc2150/extendedTicTacToe/models. The driver of the code is located in 
cpsc2150/extendedTicTacToe. This game allows the user to choose the size of the board, the amount of players, the symbols to represent the players, and whether the user would 
like to use a memory efficient implementation or a fast implementation.
